# Street Racing ML
I created this for my own curiousty into how machine learning works.

Also I created this for my school's science fair. This is one of the few projects I plan to make about ai.

I used a library called ml-agents created by Unity which allows you to easily make ML enviroments: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents

I also used a python enviroment called Anaconda for training and analasis of the agents using Tensorflow.

The Ai was trained to put collecting points a the highest priority. This leads the ai sometimes to be too "bold" which leads to it getting trapped or crashing into cars.
