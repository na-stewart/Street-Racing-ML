# Street Racing ML
I created this for my own curiousty into how machine learning works.

Also I created this for my school's science fair. This is one of the few projects I plan to make about ai.

After review, I think that my only mistake was the putting the car's to close to the obstacle cars for their starting point. This application was a great learning experience and I plan on experimenting more with Ai in the future. 

##  How to use
1. Download the setup file from the releases tab.
3. Decompile the application and you should be able to run it!
