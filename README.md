# Street Racing ML
I created this for my own curiousty into how machine learning works.

Also I created this for my school's science fair. This is one of the few projects I plan to make about ai.

I used a library called ml-agents created by Unity which allows you to easily make ML enviroments: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents

I also used a python enviroment called Anaconda for training and analasis.

The ai was trained to put collecting points as the highest priority. 

##  How to use
1. Download the setup file from the releases tab.
3. Decompile the application and you should be able to run it!
