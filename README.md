# Street Racing ML
I created this for my own curiousty into how machine learning works.

I created this for my school's science fair. This was one of the few projects I made about AI. Another project that is not public was a program that would play music based off of how a user felt using facial recognition.

After review, I think that my only mistake was the putting the car's to close to the obstacle cars for their starting point. This application was a great learning experience and I plan on experimenting more with AI in the future. 

Leave running for about 5 mins and it's avoiding capabilites will improve. 

##  How to use
1. Download the setup file from the releases tab.
3. Decompile the application and you should be able to run it!
